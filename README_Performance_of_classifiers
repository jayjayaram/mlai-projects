README:
Performance of the classifiers you mentioned (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) using a dataset
The program uses the Iris dataset from scikit-learn library, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains each classifier. 
It then makes predictions on the testing set and calculates the accuracy score for each classifier. 
Finally, it prints the accuracy scores for comparison.
